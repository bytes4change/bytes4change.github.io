We are a group of high school students who are passionate about computer science and have seen the impacts it can make on any community through continuous effort. We are dedicated to making a difference using technology while learning and honing our skills along the way. All work we do is non-profit; we volunteer our time and effort into this project because we truly believe in our cause.
