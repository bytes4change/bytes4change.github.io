Welcome to our site and our first post! We are Bytes4Change, a group of students from Barrington, RI who are passionate about using technology to make a difference in the world. We are mainly focused on web development using the Jekyll static site generator software, as well as potentially other code-related projects down the line. Please bear with us as we build out our site and add more content, and get in touch if you are interested in collaborating with us!
